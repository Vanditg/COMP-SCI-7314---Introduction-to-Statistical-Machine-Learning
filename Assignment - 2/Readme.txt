There are three ways to run the code given. 

-- Jupyter Notebook attached here in zip file. 
-- Github repository: The file and report has been open-sourced here - https://github.com/Vanditg/COMP-SCI-7314---Introduction-to-Statistical-Machine-Learning
-- Google Colab repository: The colab repo can be found here - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JR6UzXxQQTvAnMlhsKHNNoViBnWZ0KRL?usp=sharing

----------------------------------------------
Jupyter Notebook
----------------------------------------------

- Download the zip file and open the notebook file using 'Jupyter Notebook ISML_a2.ipynb' 
- There will be some modules error occurs if the system will not compitable. Please install those module using Pip install --module_name
- Please change the path where the dataset file is in the local directory and Run the commands and it will produces results in sometime based on CPU/GPU computing power. 

----------------------------------------------
Github Repository
----------------------------------------------

- Fork or Download the Github Repository
- Change the directory to Assignment 2
- Run the notebook using 'Jupyter Notebook ISML_a2.ipynb'
- If any error occurs please see the above description and after running the notebook the results will be produced in sometime based on CPU/GPU Computing power. 

----------------------------------------------
Google Colab Repository
----------------------------------------------

- Easy way to view and access the code
- Checkpoints are saved here, where results are already produced
